In this [pdf file](https://github.com/issel-ml-squad/ads/blob/master/datasets.pdf) you can find the datasets with their references used for training the ADS system. Because the file is from a diploma thesis written in Greek the translation is the following:

- Όνομα -> Name
- Πηγή -> Source
- Πεδίο -> Domain/Field
- Τύπος -> Type
- Π.Π. -> Number of Instances
- Π.X. -> Number of Attributes
- Κλάση -> Class
- Ναι/Όχι -> Yes/No
